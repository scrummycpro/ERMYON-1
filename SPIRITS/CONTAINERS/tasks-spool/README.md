## Docker Image Documentation: Mini-Queue with Task Spooler (tsp)

### Overview

This Docker image provides a queue-like functionality using Task Spooler (`tsp`) within a Docker container. Task Spooler is a Unix batch system where tasks (commands) are queued and executed sequentially or in parallel.

### Features

- **Task Management**: Queue tasks to be executed sequentially or in parallel.
- **Flexibility**: Mount a local directory to interact with files from the host system.
- **Integration**: Use Docker commands for container management and task execution.

### Docker Image Details

- **Base Image**: Ubuntu latest
- **Installed Packages**:
  - Task Spooler (`tsp`)
  - FFmpeg (for multimedia processing tasks)

### Dockerfile

Here is the Dockerfile used to build the Docker image:

```dockerfile
# Use a base image
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Install Task Spooler and any necessary dependencies
RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y \
        task-spooler \
        ffmpeg \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Create a directory for tasks (optional)
RUN mkdir /app

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app
```

### Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if not already done):

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**:

   ```bash
   docker build -t mini-queue-tsp .
   ```

   - `-t mini-queue-tsp`: Tags the built image with the name `mini-queue-tsp`. You can change `mini-queue-tsp` to any desired name.

### Running the Docker Container

After building the Docker image, you can run the container in interactive or detached mode.

#### Interactive Mode (for testing and interactive use):

```bash
docker run -it --name tsp-container -v "$(pwd):/app" mini-queue-tsp
```

- `-it`: Interactive mode with a pseudo-TTY for command line interaction.
- `--name tsp-container`: Name of the container (`tsp-container` in this case).
- `-v "$(pwd):/app"`: Mounts the current directory into `/app` directory inside the container for file access.

#### Detached Mode (for running in the background):

```bash
docker run -d --name tsp-container -v "$(pwd):/app" mini-queue-tsp
```

- `-d`: Detached mode, runs the container in the background.

### Managing Tasks with Task Spooler (`tsp`)

Once the container is running, you can use Task Spooler (`tsp`) commands to manage tasks:

- **Add a task**:

  ```bash
  docker exec tsp-container tsp echo "Hello, World!"
  ```

  This example adds an echo task to Task Spooler queue.

- **Monitor tasks**:

  ```bash
  docker exec tsp-container tsp
  ```

  This command shows the status of tasks in the queue.

- **View task output**:

  ```bash
  docker exec tsp-container tsp -o <jobid>
  ```

  Replace `<jobid>` with the job ID obtained from `tsp` command output.

### Interacting with Files

Files can be manipulated from the host machine via the mounted volume:

- **Create files**:

  ```bash
  docker exec tsp-container sh -c 'touch /app/blue && touch /app/red'
  ```

  This command creates `blue` and `red` files in the `/app` directory inside the container.

### Additional Information

- **Logs**: View container logs with `docker logs tsp-container`.
- **Stopping the Container**: Use `docker stop tsp-container`.
- **Removing the Container**: Use `docker rm tsp-container`.
- **Restarting the Container**: Use `docker restart tsp-container`.

### Conclusion

This Docker image provides a flexible and scalable solution for managing tasks using Task Spooler (`tsp`) within a containerized environment. By leveraging Docker commands and `tsp`, you can efficiently queue, manage, and execute tasks while maintaining isolation and flexibility.
