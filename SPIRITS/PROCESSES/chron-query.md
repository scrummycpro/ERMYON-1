# chron-query.sh Documentation

## Overview

The `chron-query.sh` script is designed to search for a specified term in a SQLite database table and retrieve matching responses. It provides flexibility in output format, allowing either plain text or JSON depending on user preference.

## Usage

### Script Invocation

```bash
./chron-query.sh [-j] <search_term> <table_name>
```

### Options

- `-j`: Outputs results in JSON format.

### Example Usage

```bash
# Search for the term "science" in the "chemistry" table and output as plain text
./chron-query.sh "science" "chemistry"

# Search for the term "science" in the "chemistry" table and output as JSON
./chron-query.sh -j "science" "chemistry"
```

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure the following:

1. **SQLite Database**: The script assumes a SQLite database named `responses.db` is present in the same directory.
   
   To list available tables in the database, run:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 responses.db ".schema"
   ```

2. **SQLite and jq**: Make sure `sqlite3` (for querying SQLite databases) and `jq` (for JSON formatting, if using `-j` option) are installed on your system.

## Functionality

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Argument Parsing**: Parses command-line options and validates input arguments.
   
2. **SQLite Query Execution**:
   - Constructs a SQLite query based on the provided `search_term` and `table_name`.
   - Executes the query to retrieve responses from the specified table where the response contains the search term.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - Depending on whether the `-j` option is used:
     - If `-j` is specified, formats the query results as JSON using `jq`.
     - Otherwise, outputs the query results as plain text.

## Example Workflow

### 1. Simple Query and Output

```bash
./chron-query.sh "science" "chemistry"
```

This command searches for occurrences of "science" in the "chemistry" table of the `responses.db` database and prints the results in plain text.

### 2. JSON Output

```bash
./chron-query.sh -j "science" "chemistry"
```
#### Remove new line characters
```bash
bash chron-query.sh -j "science" chemistry|sed -e 's/\\n//g' -e 's/\*//g' -e 's/\\//g'
```

This command searches for occurrences of "science" in the "chemistry" table and outputs the results in JSON format, encapsulated in a `responses` JSON object.

### 3. Creating a Static Webpage

To create a static webpage with the search results, you can use:

```bash
./chron-query.sh "science" "chemistry" > testdoc.md && pandoc testdoc.md -o testdoc.html
```

This command performs a search for "science" in the "chemistry" table, writes the results to `testdoc.md`, and then converts `testdoc.md` to `testdoc.html` using `pandoc`, allowing you to view the results in a formatted HTML page.

## Notes

- **Security**: Ensure that user inputs are sanitized to prevent SQL injection attacks, especially when accepting input directly from users or untrusted sources.
- **Performance**: Depending on the size of the database and complexity of queries, performance may vary.
- **Maintenance**: Keep the SQLite database schema (`responses.db`) and corresponding tables up-to-date with your application's requirements.

## Conclusion

The `chron-query.sh` script provides a straightforward way to query and retrieve data from SQLite databases, offering flexibility in output formats to suit different integration and reporting needs.
