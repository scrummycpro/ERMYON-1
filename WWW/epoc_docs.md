Certainly! Here's a more detailed documentation for the script (`convert_to_epoch_md.sh`) that converts Markdown files to HTML using Pandoc and saves them with filenames containing an epoch timestamp:

# Markdown to HTML Conversion with Epoch Timestamp

This script converts Markdown files to HTML format using Pandoc and saves each converted file with a filename that includes an epoch timestamp for uniqueness.

### Prerequisites

- **Pandoc**: Ensure Pandoc is installed and accessible from the command line. You can install Pandoc by following the instructions on [Pandoc's installation page](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).

### Usage

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x convert_to_epoch_md.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   Replace `<folder_name>` with the name of the folder containing the Markdown files created by `random_response.sh`.

   ```bash
   ./convert_to_epoch_md.sh <folder_name>
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   ./convert_to_epoch_md.sh my_responses_table_folder
   ```

### Script Explanation

The script performs the following steps:

- **Argument Handling**: Checks if a folder name is provided as an argument.
- **Iteration**: Iterates through each Markdown file (`*.md`) in the specified folder.
- **File Processing**: Uses Pandoc to convert each Markdown file to HTML format and saves it with a filename that includes an epoch timestamp (`$(date +%s)` ensures uniqueness).
- **Output Message**: Displays a message for each file converted, indicating the source and destination paths.

### Example Output

For each Markdown file in the specified folder (`<folder_name>`), the script will convert it to HTML format using Pandoc and save it with a filename like `<original_filename>_timestamp.html` in the same folder.

### Notes

- Adjust the Pandoc command (`pandoc "${file}" -o "${output_file}"`) to specify the desired output format (e.g., PDF, DOCX) and adjust the output file extension accordingly.
- Ensure permissions are set correctly to allow file creation in the specified folder.
- The script assumes you want to convert Markdown files to HTML format. Modify the Pandoc command and options based on your specific conversion needs.
